# posts-express-api-app

The main goal is to build the backend. I copied the frontend from Udemy.

## What is this app

1. The goal is to build a REST API (data) app.
2. There is a React frontend, but it's optional.
3. The API endpoints work independently too.

## Code

- backend: root folder
- frontend: [/frontend](/frontend)

## To run

1. Do `npm install` at root folder, and inside `/frontend`.
2. To start frontend - `npm run fe`. To run be - `npm run be`.
3. To start both (e.g. at deployment machine) - run `npm run serve`
